Getting and Cleaning Data course project
========================================

In this directory you can find 3 files:

- README.md  This file
- run_analysis.R  The R script that produces the final dataset
- codebook.md Explains the content of the final dataset

To run the script download the raw data from 

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

and unzip this file in a directory of your choice.
Open R and set the working directory in the "UCI HAR Dataset" sub-dir of the directory
where you unzipped the file.
Run the script. At the end the "result" variable will contain the dataset described in
codebook.md
